When it comes to designing APIs, two approaches stand out: REST (Representational State Transfer) and GraphQL. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, and choosing the right one depends on your specific needs and use cases. In this blog, we’ll explore the key differences between GraphQL and REST, and help you determine which API design might be best for your project.",
